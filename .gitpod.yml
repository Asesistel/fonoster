# This '.gitpod.yml' file when placed at the root of a project instructs
# Gitpod how to prepare & build the project, start development environments
# and configure continuous prebuilds. Prebuilds when enabled builds a project
# like a CI server so you can start coding right away - no more waiting for
# dependencies to download and builds to finish when reviewing pull-requests
# or hacking on something new.
